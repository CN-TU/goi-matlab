CVTbed v1.0
FIV, Dec 2017

Description:
--------------------------------------------
CVTbed v1.0 is a testbed for Cluster Validation implemented in the MATLAB environment (R2016a). 
GOI indices (absolute cluster validation indices) are included in the testbed.


Folder and files:
--------------------------------------------
[algorithms]: contains clustering algorithms
[datasets]: example datasets
[density_test]: test of dependency between density and dimensionality  
[logs]: stores log-files generated by "clustperf_comp.m"
[mdcgen]: dataset generator
[mmod_test]: test for testing multimodality detection
[processing]: scrips for additional data processing (plotting, normalization, etc.)
[validity]: scripts for cluster validation
[vic_test]: test for comparing validity indices
"clustout.m": performs clustering with outlier detection and density correction if selected
"clustperf_comp.m": compares clustering performances by calculating validity indices
"comparison_example.m": runs a example of clustering performances in a 2D-scenario with different "k" values
"README": this file
"start.m": runs a wizard for selecting 2D-datasets and parameters for comparing solutions with different "k" values

Requirements:
--------------------------------------------
"mdcgen" is required to generate datasets for some functions. You can download it from here:
https://github.com/felixig/mdcgen-matlab
Simply create a [mdcgen] folder and save the "mdcgen.m" script inside.
